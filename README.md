# No "Activate Windows"
A program that hides the "Activate Windows" watermark on unlicensed installations.

## How to use
First, obtain the `no_activate_windows.dll` file by either compiling this project or downloading it from the [latest release](https://github.com/lanylow/no_activate_windows/releases/latest), then you have to inject it into `explorer.exe` and the watermark should be gone.
